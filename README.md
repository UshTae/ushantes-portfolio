## Goals
The Employer wants to view my portfolio in considering me as a candidate for an open position. To achieve this, the portfolio had to fullfil:
- Present my name, a recent photo and links to sections about me, work and how to contact me when the page was loaded.
- All links in the navigation had to have th UI scroll to the corresponding section.
- My first appliction example's image in the work section had to be larger than the others.
- The images of the applications took the employer to the deployed application.
- The page was fully responsive, adapting to the employer's viewport.
